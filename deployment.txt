1. While deployment, only Backend repository is hosted on the deployment platform
    e.g. Heroku, Render, Digital Ocean, Amazon EC2, etc.


2. But what about frontend? Frontend build file is placed inside backend folder before deployment
    which is obtained by running command "npm run build" at frontend. That Build folder
    is placed inside another client folder in backend repository.
    Whenever there is a new update in frontend, then we need to rebuild the frontend and again 
    copying the build folder to backend client (Make sure to delete old build from backend)



3. Paste below code before server start in backend index.js (install and import path)


  app.use(express.static("client/build"));
  app.get("*", (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(
      path.resolve(__dirname + "/client/build/index.html"),
      function (err) {
        if (err) {
          console.log(err);
        }
      }
    );
  });

  4. If all the above steps are successful, then you can access the project at localhost:port\

  5. Make your port number dynamic
    Define port like this, => const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000
    This is done to dynamically allocate a port number to our server by the hosting provider (heroku/render)

  6. Make sure your database is remotely located (On Atlas Not on localhost)

 7. Make sure you don't have any secrets or keys or passwords hardcoded.
    Mention all secret keys or urls inside .env file (by downloading dotenv (npm i dotenv)) 
    and make sure to gitignore .env

 8. Make sure to define your START command in package.json file

9. Push Backend into a github repository.
